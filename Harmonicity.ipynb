    "We saw at the <a href = \"https://ursinus-cs472a-s2021.github.io/Modules/Module3/Video1\">third module</a> that a vibrating string supports different frequencies that are integer multiples of a base frequency, known as \"harmonics\" or \"overtones.\"  Let's look at a few examples of base frequencies and their harmonics.  We'll start with a base frequency of 220hz, and then we'll also look at a base frequency of 440z, which is known as its \"octave\" (the space in between these two frequencies is also referred to as an \"octave\").  We perceive these notes to be the same pitch, because we perceive pitch *logarithmically* in frequency.  In other words, *multiplying a sequence of frequencies by a constant amount will lead to a constant additive shift in our perception*.\n",

    "Finally, we'll look at frequencies at 330hz and 275hz, which are in 3/2 ratios and 5/4 ratios of 220hz, and which are known as *fifths* and *third*, respectively.  And we look at another frequency, 313, which forms a \"tri tone\" with respect to 220hz"
